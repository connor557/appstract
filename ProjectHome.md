The primary goal of AppStract is to develop an open source portable application virtualization system.
The project originally started as a bachelor thesis, which was so successful that I decided to continue working on it as a personal research project.

The source code is licensed under GPLv3.0 and is provided as is, without any warranty. If you decide to try and run the code it is recommended to do so in a test-environment like a (disposable) virtual machine.

[My original thesis document](http://appstract.googlecode.com/files/Thesis-v1.pdf) is available if you'd like to learn more about the code base or about application virtualization in general. Please note that this documentation is not kept up to date since [revision 108](https://code.google.com/p/appstract/source/detail?r=108).
